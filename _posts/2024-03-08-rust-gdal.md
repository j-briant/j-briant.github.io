I've been trying to learn Rust lately. For some reason there is something that I find very appealing in this language. From all I could read, it's very efficient in resources and memory, it's fast, and it doesn't let you mess around with memory. Regarding performances, it places itself next to C and C++, and when looking into the world of language perormances, I learned that Python was kind of slow, around 100x slower according to some benchmarks. Obviously this value in itself doesn't mean much, and many more aspects of a language must be taken account when choosing one for the task, but this information kind of planted its seed. It might be because I have a problem with unefficient and overly complicated process, but I find the idea to work with a system language very elegant.

But we're not here to talk about the Rust language in itself. We'll see how to read and write raster data using the Rust binding for GDAL. Also, this is about how I tried to compare the Rust and Python bindings for GDAL and how I learned that it doesn't change a thing in terms of performance.

## Wait what?

Well I started thinking "Oh I can't wait to see how faster GDAL in Rust is compared to Python". So I started by reading a raster file and print some basic information. I use a band from a [Sentinel-2 image](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/).

### How to open a raster file?

Let's do it.

In Rust:

```rust
use gdal::Dataset;

// Open dataset
let ds = Dataset::open("IMG.jp2").unwrap();
println!("This raster has {} bands.", ds.raster_count());

// Read band
let band = ds.rasterband(1).unwrap();

// Print statistics
if let Some(stats) = band.get_statistics(true, true).unwrap() {
    println!(
        "[ STATS ] =  Minimum={}, Maximum={}, Mean={}, StdDev={}",
        stats.min, stats.max, stats.mean, stats.std_dev
    );
};
```

> I'm using a lot of .unwrap(), which in very short will cause the code to panic if a problem occurs, this is for a quick and dirty test. Within a "production" environment you would handle errors and stuff. 
{: .prompt-warning }

And in Python:

```python
from osgeo import gdal
gdal.UseExceptions()

# Open dataset
dataset = gdal.Open('IMG.jp2')
nband = dataset.RasterCount
print(f'This raster contains {nband} bands.') 

# Read band
srcband = dataset.GetRasterBand(1)

# Print statistics
stats = srcband.GetStatistics( True, True )
print(f'[ STATS ] =  Minimum=%.3f, Maximum=%.3f, Mean=%.3f, StdDev=%.3f' % ( stats[0], stats[1], stats[2], stats[3] ))
```

File opened and information read. We can compare their runtime.

### Comparing performances

Building the Rust program, then running and timing these two codes multiple times, we get results like follows:

|Rust|Python|
|---|---|
|real    **0m0.072s**|real    **0m0.156s**|
|user    0m0.154s|user    0m0.752s|
|sys     0m0.275s|sys     0m1.689s|

> This is a naive approach on testing and comparing performances, not a full-fledged benchmark. 
{: .prompt-warning }

Twice as fast without any processing or multi-threading, at that point I though "Oh it's gonna be good".

## Let's add some writing then

It's only the start, we'll now read the data in our raster dataset and, since my source is in .jp2, write it in a new raster dataset in the GeoTiff format.

### How to write a raster dataset with GDAL bindings?

We will be using the Create() approach rather than the CreateCopy(). Geospatialized rasters come with series of metadata and overviews. The CreateCopy() automatically takes those from the source dataset and copy them into the destination. While this obviously simplifies the work if we don't need to bring any change to these information, using Create() helps to better understand the structure of a raster. Also I have a quite important performance difference between the two and I've found Create() more efficient for my usecase.

So the code now becomes:

In Rust: 

```rust
// Open dataset
let ds = Dataset::open("IMG.jp2").unwrap();
println!("This raster has {} bands.", ds.raster_count());

// Get source dataset metadata
let projection = ds.projection();
let spatial_ref = ds.spatial_ref().unwrap();
let geo_transform = ds.geo_transform().unwrap();
let (x, y) = ds.raster_size();

// Read band
let band = ds.rasterband(1).unwrap();

// Get GeoTiff driver  
let d = DriverManager::get_driver_by_name("GTiff").unwrap();

// Create the destination dataset as mutable with 1 band
let mut dst_ds = d.create_with_band_type::<u16, _>("IMG_as_tiff.gtiff", x as isize, y as isize, 1).unwrap();

// Set metadata from source dataset
dst_ds.set_geo_transform(&geo_transform).unwrap();
dst_ds.set_projection(&projection).unwrap();
dst_ds.set_spatial_ref(&spatial_ref).unwrap();

// Get the destination band as mutable
let mut dst_band = dst_ds.rasterband(1).unwrap();

// Read the source data as Buffer<u16>
let buf = band.read_as::<u16>((0,0), (x, y), (x, y), None).unwrap();

// Write the data in the destination band
dst_band.write((0,0), (x, y), &buf).unwrap();

// Close dataset for good conscience
ds.close().unwrap();
dst_ds.close().unwrap();
```

And in Python: 

```python
# Open dataset
ds = gdal.Open('IMG.jp2')
nband = ds.RasterCount
print(f'This raster has {nband} bands.')

# Get dataset metadata
srcprojection = ds.GetProjection()
srcspatialref = ds.GetSpatialRef()
srcgeotransform = ds.GetGeoTransform()
(xsize, ysize) = (ds.RasterXSize, ds.RasterYSize)

# Get GeoTiff driver
fileformat = "GTiff"
driver = gdal.GetDriverByName(fileformat)

# Create the destination dataset with 1 band
dst_ds = driver.Create('IMG_as_tiff.gtiff', xsize=xsize, ysize=ysize,
                    bands=nband, eType=gdal.GDT_UInt16)

# Set metadata from source dataset
dst_ds.SetProjection(srcprojection)
dst_ds.SetGeoTransform(srcgeotransform)
dst_ds.SetSpatialRef(srcspatialref)

# Get the destination band
srcband = ds.GetRasterBand(1)

# Read the source data as Array
srcdata = srcband.ReadAsArray()

# Write the data in the destination band
dst_ds.GetRasterBand(1).WriteArray(srcdata)

# Close dataset for good conscience
ds = None
dst_ds = None
```

Both codes should create a new raster file that ressemble our source, but in GeoTiff.

### Comparing performances again

Now let's see how powerful Rust can be.

|Rust|Python|
|---|---|
|real    **0m1.024s**|real    **0m1.133s**|
|user    0m17.150s|user    0m17.335s|
|sys     0m1.629s|sys     0m2.089s|
_Run 1_

Wait let me rerun.

|Rust|Python|
|---|---|
|real    **0m1.053s**|real    **0m1.141s**|
|user    0m17.076s|user    0m17.324s|
|sys     0m1.608s|sys     0m2.134s|
_Run 2_

Hmm.

## Wait what? (bis)

Well that's not what I expected. In the process I forgot something important, we are working with bindings. Asking Wikipedia what a binding is:

> In programming and software design, binding is an application programming interface (API) that provides glue code specifically made to allow a programming language to use a foreign library or operating system service (one that is not native to that language).

So from my understanding, working with Rust or Python or any other language bindings is just working with the API that let us call the underlying code, for GDAL written in C and C++. Thus the overhead that we generate is only the interaction with the library, not during the process itself, since it's running C/C++ code.
