I've recently been appointed at my job to implement a "geospatial strategy", whatever this means to the people requesting. From my side, two feelings are fighting:

1. I'm excited because it feels like it's a very necessary thing, and I'm happy to be given the responsibility. From my perspective it's something that should have been done years ago.
2. The motivations behind are unclear and I fear that I won't be able to align what I think is necessary with what my hierarchy expects to achieve with it, but I'll come back to that.

I'll share my thoughts, discussions, tries and errors, successes and fails in these articles. It will be a series, but I don't know how many episodes since the process my take a while before anything is achieved. The aim is to give feedbacks on what I'll try, what succeeds, what fails, in hope that it could help someone else.

This first part will be dedicated to the starting thoughts and researches, the material that I'll use to guide my though process, and my first discussions with different stakeholders.

### Context

Let's start with some context to understand the situation where I evolve.

I work in a medium sized local administration (for swiss standards). The city for which I work employs around 5000 people, and is home for around 150'000 inhabitants.

My position is called "GIS specialist", I'm engineer, I don't manage people. I'm working in the cadaster department, within which we form a kind of hybrid unit of people working on a geospatial portal and a kind of EDM tool. We are not part of an IT department, but still have some relations. However our unit manage its own servers, not using the same standards as the IT department.

### Objectives

One I received the "mandate" to think about and setup a geospatial strategy, I started to go straight into literature, looking for feedbacks from other organizations. I quickly realized that I wasn't even sure what I was asked, what is the definition of a _geospatial strategy_? What are its objectives? One important thing to note is that the environment I'm working in is very partitioned; departments communicate through hierarchy, but down in the organization chart you don't get much information. And it's very true for objectives as well, when I'm trying to motivate collective work with other departments, the discussion is usually rapidly steering into: "How can **our service** position itself?", but I feel like if you don't think about the broader picture you don't have anything to position yourself into. Then your purpose is centered around yourself, not transversely.

#### What is a geospatial strategy?

To get started I took a lot of inspiration from the ESRI document [The value of a geospatial strategy](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/en-us/media/technical-papers/the-value-of-a-geospatial-strategy-guide.pdf?adumkts=industry_solutions&aduse=national_government&aduc=industry_manager_outreach&aduSF=112021&utm_Source=industry_manager_outreach&aduca=cra_national_government_community_building&aduco=technicalpaper&adut=geospatialstrat&adulb=multiple&adusn=multiple&aduat=whitepaper&adupt=awareness&pi_content=d9792e619a72a7d0be87d66dd7a4ad6cc43e68e49f4d5dd09518e4da3f0dbbb7).

> A geospatial strategy is a business-oriented plan for how organizations will leverage their geospatial resources (people, processes, and technology) to produce the outcomes itâ€™s trying to create.

Rather simple and generic enough, a plan around geospatial resources to reach objectives. We need to define these objectives.

#### Align the visions

That's a major step to validate. I made a first round of literature research but if everything I do is not what is expected then it's all for nothing. To do so I'll define a **vision** for the strategy. It will act as a rather abstract and large scale path and define what will be its objectives, its scope and the potential stakeholders it will bring together. Once I have this vision, I'll motivate it and present it to executives commanding the strategy. We'll have to meet on the terms of the strategy at this point, I hope that through a constructive discussion, we'll find a way of developing an ambitious strategy, addressing multiple challenges and bringing a diverse set of people around the table. But most importantly that we will align our visions.

If I must present a example of diverging visions, here is how it would look:

- My _vision_ for the strategy would include the whole organization, the strategy would listen to most of the main stakeholders objectives and challenges. This would result in a methodology going from large to small scale, trying to define global objectives and building solutions to reach them.
- My executives _vision_ would focus on their organizational unit, defining its objectives and the added value it could bring to the organization. This strategy would start small and would hope to extend to other departments through exemplarity. The department would provide services that other units could request through a set of well defined governance.

Both are valid but one thing is for certain, **if we don't align our visions, the strategy will never answer the expected needs.**

#### My initial proposition

My starting point for the discussion will look something like:

- **Strategy objectives** --> Look at the broad situation and define a common goal for the organization, take this opportunity to bring together the organization by taking into account objectives/challenges from multiple services.
