I've recently been appointed at my job to implement a "geospatial strategy", whatever this means to the people requesting. From my side, two feelings are fighting:

1. I'm exciting because it feels like it's a very necessary thing, and I'm happy to be given the responsability. From my perspective it's something that should have been done years ago.
2. The motivations behind are unclear and I fear that I won't be able to align what I think is necessary with what my hierarchy expects to achieve with it, but I'll come back to that.

I'll share my thoughts, discussions, tries and errors, successes and fails in these articles. It will be a series, but I don't know how many episodes since the process my take a while before anything is achieved. The aim is to give feedbacks on what I'll try, what succeeds, what fails, in hope that it could help someone else.

This first part will be dedicated to the starting thougths and researches, the material that I'll use to guide my though process, and my first discussions with different stakeholders.

### Context

Let's start with some context to understand the situation where I evolve.

I work in a medium sized local administration (for swiss standards). The city for which I work employs around 5000 people, and is home for around 150'000 inhabitants.

My position is called "GIS specialist", I'm engineer, I don't manage people. I'm working in the cadastre department, within which we form a kind of hybrid unit of people working on a geospatial portal and a kind of EDM tool. We are not part of an IT department, but still have some relations. However our unit manage its own servers, not using the same standards as the IT department.
