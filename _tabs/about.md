Wassup, I'm Julien, from Lausanne, CH. At first I was environmental science engineer, but then I decided that I didn't want to be an environemental science engineer, so I became remote sensing and GIS "touche-Ã -tout", as we say in french. Since then I'm trying to understand what it means to create, store and share (spatial) data to people. I'm very interested in the technical aspects behind an efficient data infrastructure, but also the organizational implications.

Somehow I thought that my experience could be interesting to share, and this website appeared. It is a collection of encountered tools, thoughts, tries and probably a lot of venting. Hopefully you'll find something helpful around here.

Pretty sure that things can be complex without being messy.

This website is build using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the theme [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).
